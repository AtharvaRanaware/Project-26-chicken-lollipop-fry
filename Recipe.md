FIRST IN A BOWL MIX DAHI AND CHICKEN       

ADD HALDI,SALT,GARAM MASALA AND RED CHILLI POWDER TO IT      

MIX IT WELL     

THEN LET IT MARINATE IN FRIDGE FOR 3 HOURS      

WITHDRAW IT FROM THE FRIDGE AND LET IT REST FOR 15 MINUTES      

TILL IT RESTS TAKE A DEEP FRY PAN AND PUT THE OIL IN IT SO THAT IT CAN BECOME READY TO FRY IMMEDIATELY          

BECAUSE YOU MUST'VE WAITED FOR IT FOR 3 HOURS       

NOW TAKE ONE PIECE AND SLOWLY PUT IT IN THE BOILING OIL     

IF THERE IS ENOUGH SPACE IN YOUR PAN THEN YOU CAN PUT UPTO 5 PIECES PER TIME       

FRY UNTIL GOLDEN-DARKBROWN AND MAKE SURE THAT IT SHOULD REMAIN CRISPY.....        

AFTER FRYING PLACE IT IN A PLATE AND U MAY ALSO DECORATE IT WITH SOME VEGGIES       

YOU R READY TO EAT YOUR HAND MADE CHIKEN FRY-LOLLIPOP!!!!! :)
